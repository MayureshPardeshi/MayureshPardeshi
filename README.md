I. Goal: To solve the cancer detection problem by the open-source project, for effective further treatment.

II. Aim: To design an Artificial Intelligence (AI) model exclusively for the detection of the cancer affected cells/tumors/genes.

III. Problem: Increase in the recent cancer cases world-wide has affected the human population at an alarming rate. The treatment measures required are time consuming, with long term assistive care has become a necessity. Subsequently, the side effects of multiple sessions or improper detection can make the health more severe.

IV. Objectives:
1.	To study and analyze the basic organs affected by the cancer.
2.	To develop a dataset quality improvement model for quality management.
3.	To design a deep learning based hyper-tuned model for the affected area detection.
4.	Experimentation on international datasets for the model evaluation.

V. Content

Health is the highest priority for all human beings, which is usually neglected due to improper lifestyle and appropriate diet. Due to external affecting factors such as addictions, pollutions, family genes, there are chances of getting severe diseases as cancer, which indicates the statistics are growing at alarmingly high rate. Artificial intelligence (AI) has proved to be effective is various field and has achieved phenomenal success in the medical domain in the recent years. Due to the high costs of the medical expenses for the hospital, affected patients, it is becoming challenging to add a new technology approaches for the benefit of the humanity. We look forward to solve the detection and identification issues for better further medical treatment. This initiative of open source project is made for the well-being of the society.
